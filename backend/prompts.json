    "user_query": "Answer the user's question on ongoing political issues. If the user's question is completely irrelevant, let them know the limitations to abilities (ex: 'I can only answer questions related to ____'. Use the `rag` tool to fetch legislative documents in order to inform your answer. Ensure the response is specific to the documents returned, rather than something general. For example, the rag tool currently has access to Vermont state legislature documents. As such, if the user asks, 'tell me about our policies on agricultural taxes,' shape your response in the context of the Vermont state legislature. Ensure responses are also temporally relevant by considering the date range for the `rag` tool. Your final answer should be a text response summarizing the findings from the documents."
