This credit lowers your annual school tax bill. To pay for this, the tax rate on second homes and rental properties (called 'non-homestead' properties) will go up slightly."

The new law creates a $500 'Property Tax Credit' for all owner-occupied primary residences (homesteads). This policy is intended to lower the education tax burden on Vermont homeowners. To keep the bill revenue-neutral, the cost will be offset by a minor increase to the 'non-homestead' tax rate, which applies to second homes and investment properties."

This bill modifies the Property Tax Credit available to properties qualifying as a 'homestead' (primary domicile) pursuant to 32 V.S.A. § 6066a. This $500 credit is applied directly against the owner's annual statewide education tax liability. The revenue impact is offset by a corresponding adjustment to the non-homestead rate and the application of a new 'Statewide Adjustment' (SA) to the Common Level of Appraisal (CLA)."
